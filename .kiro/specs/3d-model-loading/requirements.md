7. WHEN loading is cancelled THEN the system SHALL abort loading gracefully and clean up partial data

### Requirement 7: Integration with Resource Management

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want 3D model loading to integrate with the engine's resource management so that I can use consistent caching and memory management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN models are loaded THEN they SHALL be managed by the engine's ResourceManager system
2. WHEN the same model is requested multiple times THEN the system SHALL return cached instances
3. WHEN models reference shared textures THEN the system SHALL use the existing texture resource system
