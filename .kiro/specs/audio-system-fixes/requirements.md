# Audio System Fixes - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current audio system has several critical issues that make it behave unlike a normal game:

1. Background music loops accelerated instead of playing once and restarting when finished
2. Jump sound only works in movement mode 1 (CharacterMovement)
3. Footstep sounds don't stop immediately when character stops moving
4. Footstep sounds don't work in movement modes 2 and 3
5. Audio reloads completely when switching movement components (unacceptable behavior)

This spec addresses these issues to create a professional, game-ready audio system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Stable Audio System

**User Story:** As a player, I want the audio system to remain stable and not reload when switching movement modes, so that the game feels professional and responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN switching between movement components THEN audio clips SHALL remain loaded in memory
2. WHEN switching between movement components THEN background music SHALL continue playing without interruption
3. WHEN switching between movement components THEN audio sources SHALL be preserved and reused
4. WHEN switching between movement components THEN there SHALL be no audio reloading or initialization delays

### Requirement 2: Proper Background Music Behavior

**User Story:** As a player, I want background music to play naturally (once through, then restart), so that it sounds like normal game music.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN background music starts THEN it SHALL play once through completely
2. WHEN background music finishes THEN it SHALL automatically restart from the beginning
3. WHEN background music is playing THEN it SHALL NOT loop in an accelerated manner
4. WHEN background music restarts THEN there SHALL be no gap or audio artifacts

### Requirement 3: Universal Jump Sound

**User Story:** As a player, I want to hear jump sounds regardless of which movement mode I'm using, so that audio feedback is consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN player presses jump in any movement mode THEN jump sound SHALL play
2. WHEN using CharacterMovement mode THEN jump sound SHALL work
3. WHEN using HybridMovement mode THEN jump sound SHALL work
4. WHEN using DeterministicMovement mode THEN jump sound SHALL work
5. WHEN jump sound plays THEN it SHALL be positioned at character location

### Requirement 4: Responsive Footstep Audio

**User Story:** As a player, I want footstep sounds to start and stop immediately based on my movement, so that audio feedback feels responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN character starts moving THEN footstep sounds SHALL begin playing
2. WHEN character stops moving THEN footstep sounds SHALL stop immediately
3. WHEN character is not grounded THEN footstep sounds SHALL not play
4. WHEN character is jumping THEN footstep sounds SHALL not play
5. WHEN footstep sound is playing AND character stops THEN current footstep sound SHALL be stopped immediately

### Requirement 5: Universal Footstep Support

**User Story:** As a player, I want to hear footstep sounds in all movement modes, so that audio feedback is consistent across the game.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using CharacterMovement mode AND moving THEN footstep sounds SHALL play
2. WHEN using HybridMovement mode AND moving THEN footstep sounds SHALL play
3. WHEN using DeterministicMovement mode AND moving THEN footstep sounds SHALL play
4. WHEN footstep timing is calculated THEN it SHALL be based on actual movement speed
5. WHEN footstep sounds play THEN they SHALL be positioned at character location

### Requirement 6: Clean Audio Architecture

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the audio system to be decoupled from movement components, so that audio works consistently regardless of movement implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN movement components are created THEN they SHALL NOT manage audio directly
2. WHEN character audio is needed THEN it SHALL be managed by the Character class
3. WHEN movement component changes THEN audio state SHALL be preserved
4. WHEN audio needs movement data THEN it SHALL query through well-defined interfaces
5. WHEN audio system initializes THEN it SHALL load all clips once and reuse them

### Requirement 7: Performance and Memory Efficiency

**User Story:** As a player, I want the game to run smoothly without audio-related performance issues or memory leaks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN audio clips are loaded THEN they SHALL be cached and reused
2. WHEN movement components switch THEN memory usage SHALL remain stable
3. WHEN audio sources are created THEN they SHALL be pooled and reused when possible
4. WHEN game runs for extended periods THEN audio memory usage SHALL not increase
5. WHEN audio system updates THEN it SHALL not cause frame rate drops
