# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involved integrating Bullet Physics library into the existing game engine and implementing a revolutionary component-based movement system that provides deterministic character physics alongside traditional physics simulation. The implementation includes three distinct movement approaches: Deterministic (precise control), Hybrid (physics collision with direct control), and Physics (full simulation).

**Target Platform:** Windows 10/11 with PowerShell/pwsh for build and development scripts.

**Implementation Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Achieved State:**

- ✅ Full Bullet Physics integration with comprehensive API
- ✅ Component-based movement system with three movement types
- ✅ DeterministicMovementComponent for precise, predictable character control
- ✅ HybridMovementComponent for physics collision detection with direct position control
- ✅ PhysicsMovementComponent for full physics simulation
- ✅ Runtime component switching with state preservation
- ✅ Advanced collision detection with sweep tests and ghost objects
- ✅ Comprehensive configuration system and resource management

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want to use Bullet Physics for realistic physics simulation, so that my game objects behave with accurate physics dynamics instead of manual approximations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Character is created THEN the system SHALL generate a corresponding Bullet rigid body with appropriate collision shape
2. WHEN Character movement is requested THEN the system SHALL apply forces/impulses to the Bullet rigid body instead of manual position updates

4. IF collision detection fails THEN the system SHALL log appropriate error information

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want to maintain the existing PhysicsEngine interface, so that existing game code continues to work without major refactoring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN existing game code calls PhysicsEngine methods THEN the calls SHALL be routed to Bullet Physics implementations
2. WHEN the physics engine updates THEN it SHALL maintain the same update cycle as the current implementation
3. WHEN physics objects are created or destroyed THEN the interface SHALL remain consistent with existing patterns
4. IF API changes are necessary THEN they SHALL be minimal and well-documented

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want proper resource management for physics objects, so that memory usage is efficient and there are no memory leaks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN physics objects are created THEN Bullet Physics resources SHALL be properly allocated
2. WHEN physics objects are destroyed THEN all associated Bullet Physics resources SHALL be cleaned up
3. WHEN the physics world shuts down THEN all Bullet Physics memory SHALL be properly released
4. WHEN running for extended periods THEN memory usage SHALL remain stable without leaks

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want to configure physics simulation parameters, so that I can tune the physics behavior for my specific game requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initializing physics THEN the system SHALL allow configuration of gravity, timestep, and solver iterations
2. WHEN physics objects are created THEN their properties (mass, friction, restitution) SHALL be configurable
3. WHEN simulation parameters need adjustment THEN they SHALL be modifiable at runtime
4. WHEN invalid parameters are provided THEN the system SHALL use safe defaults and log warnings

### Requirement 7 ✅ **COMPLETED**

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want a component-based movement system, so that I can choose the best movement approach for each character type in my game.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. ✅ WHEN creating a character THEN the system SHALL support multiple movement component types (Deterministic, Hybrid, Physics)
2. ✅ WHEN switching movement components THEN the transition SHALL preserve character state (position, velocity, rotation)
3. ✅ WHEN using different movement types THEN each SHALL provide distinct behavior characteristics
4. ✅ WHEN components are created THEN they SHALL follow a consistent interface and lifecycle

### Requirement 8 ✅ **COMPLETED**

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want deterministic character movement, so that I can have precise, predictable character control for players and NPCs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. ✅ WHEN using DeterministicMovementComponent THEN character movement SHALL be completely predictable and reproducible
2. ✅ WHEN applying movement input THEN the response SHALL be immediate without physics simulation delays
3. ✅ WHEN running the same input sequence THEN the results SHALL be identical across multiple runs
4. ✅ WHEN networking is required THEN deterministic movement SHALL support synchronization

### Requirement 9 ✅ **COMPLETED**

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want hybrid physics movement, so that I can combine precise control with accurate collision detection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. ✅ WHEN using HybridMovementComponent THEN collision detection SHALL use physics engine queries
2. ✅ WHEN movement is applied THEN position control SHALL remain direct and responsive
3. ✅ WHEN collisions occur THEN the system SHALL provide surface sliding and step-up detection
4. ✅ WHEN complex environments are present THEN collision accuracy SHALL be maintained without full physics simulation

### Requirement 10 ✅ **COMPLETED**

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want runtime movement component switching, so that characters can change movement behavior dynamically during gameplay.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. ✅ WHEN switching movement components THEN the transition SHALL be seamless without visual artifacts
2. ✅ WHEN component switching occurs THEN character state SHALL be preserved across the transition
3. ✅ WHEN different movement types are active THEN they SHALL be visually distinguishable for debugging
4. ✅ WHEN switching fails THEN the system SHALL maintain the previous component and log appropriate errors
