# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves integrating Bullet Physics library into the existing game engine to replace the current stub/placeholder physics implementation with a professional-grade physics engine. The current PhysicsEngine contains only empty method stubs with "// Implementation would..." comments, and the Character class uses basic manual physics (gravity, ground collision). This integration will provide real rigid body dynamics, accurate collision detection, and proper physics simulation.

**Target Platform:** Windows 10/11 with PowerShell/pwsh for build and development scripts.

**Current State:**

- PhysicsEngine has placeholder methods only
- Character uses manual physics: `m_velocity.y += m_gravity * deltaTime`
- No actual Bullet Physics integration despite being listed as dependency
- Bullet3 is configured in vcpkg but not used in code

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want to use Bullet Physics for realistic physics simulation, so that my game objects behave with accurate physics dynamics instead of manual approximations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the physics engine initializes THEN the system SHALL create a Bullet Physics world with proper configuration
2. WHEN a game object requires physics simulation THEN the system SHALL create corresponding Bullet rigid bodies
3. WHEN physics simulation runs THEN Bullet Physics SHALL handle all dynamics calculations instead of manual physics code
4. IF Bullet Physics is not available THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback gracefully

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want Character objects to use real rigid bodies, so that character movement and interactions are physically accurate and consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Character is created THEN the system SHALL generate a corresponding Bullet rigid body with appropriate collision shape
2. WHEN Character movement is requested THEN the system SHALL apply forces/impulses to the Bullet rigid body instead of manual position updates
3. WHEN Character collides with other objects THEN Bullet Physics SHALL handle collision response automatically
4. WHEN Character physics properties are modified THEN the changes SHALL be reflected in the underlying Bullet rigid body

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want accurate collision detection between all physics objects, so that interactions between game elements are realistic and predictable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN two physics objects come into contact THEN Bullet Physics SHALL detect the collision accurately
2. WHEN a collision occurs THEN the system SHALL provide collision callbacks with contact information
3. WHEN collision shapes need to be defined THEN the system SHALL support common shapes (box, sphere, capsule, mesh)
4. IF collision detection fails THEN the system SHALL log appropriate error information

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want to maintain the existing PhysicsEngine interface, so that existing game code continues to work without major refactoring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN existing game code calls PhysicsEngine methods THEN the calls SHALL be routed to Bullet Physics implementations
2. WHEN the physics engine updates THEN it SHALL maintain the same update cycle as the current implementation
3. WHEN physics objects are created or destroyed THEN the interface SHALL remain consistent with existing patterns
4. IF API changes are necessary THEN they SHALL be minimal and well-documented

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want proper resource management for physics objects, so that memory usage is efficient and there are no memory leaks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN physics objects are created THEN Bullet Physics resources SHALL be properly allocated
2. WHEN physics objects are destroyed THEN all associated Bullet Physics resources SHALL be cleaned up
3. WHEN the physics world shuts down THEN all Bullet Physics memory SHALL be properly released
4. WHEN running for extended periods THEN memory usage SHALL remain stable without leaks

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want to configure physics simulation parameters, so that I can tune the physics behavior for my specific game requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initializing physics THEN the system SHALL allow configuration of gravity, timestep, and solver iterations
2. WHEN physics objects are created THEN their properties (mass, friction, restitution) SHALL be configurable
3. WHEN simulation parameters need adjustment THEN they SHALL be modifiable at runtime
4. WHEN invalid parameters are provided THEN the system SHALL use safe defaults and log warnings
