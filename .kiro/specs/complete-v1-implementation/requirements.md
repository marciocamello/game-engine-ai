# Requirements Document - Complete v1.0 Implementation

## Introduction

This specification covers the completion of Game Engine Kiro v1.0 by implementing the missing core systems that are currently only stub implementations. The focus is on completing the Audio System with real OpenAL integration and the Resource Management system with actual file loading capabilities for textures, meshes, and audio files.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: OpenAL Audio System Implementation

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want a fully functional 3D spatial audio system so that I can create immersive audio experiences in my games.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the audio engine initializes THEN it SHALL successfully initialize OpenAL context and device
2. WHEN loading an audio file (WAV, OGG) THEN the system SHALL load and decode the audio data into OpenAL buffers
3. WHEN creating an audio source THEN the system SHALL create an OpenAL source with 3D positioning capabilities
4. WHEN playing audio THEN the system SHALL play the audio through OpenAL with proper 3D positioning
5. WHEN setting audio source position THEN the system SHALL update the OpenAL source position in 3D space
6. WHEN setting listener position and orientation THEN the system SHALL update the OpenAL listener properties
7. WHEN adjusting volume, pitch, or looping THEN the system SHALL apply these properties to the OpenAL source
8. WHEN multiple audio sources play simultaneously THEN the system SHALL mix them properly through OpenAL
9. WHEN the audio engine shuts down THEN it SHALL properly cleanup all OpenAL resources

### Requirement 2: Real Resource Loading Implementation

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want to load actual texture, mesh, and audio files so that I can use real assets in my games instead of placeholder data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading a texture file (PNG, JPG, TGA) THEN the system SHALL load and decode the image data into OpenGL textures
2. WHEN loading an audio file (WAV, OGG) THEN the system SHALL load and decode the audio data for use with the audio system
3. WHEN loading a mesh file (OBJ, basic format) THEN the system SHALL parse vertex data and create OpenGL buffers
4. WHEN a resource is already loaded THEN the system SHALL return the cached version instead of reloading
5. WHEN a resource fails to load THEN the system SHALL log an error and return a default/fallback resource
6. WHEN unloading resources THEN the system SHALL properly cleanup GPU memory and file handles
7. WHEN the resource manager shuts down THEN it SHALL cleanup all loaded resources automatically
8. WHEN checking resource memory usage THEN the system SHALL provide accurate memory statistics

### Requirement 3: Integration with Existing Systems

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want the new audio and resource systems to work seamlessly with existing engine components so that I can use them immediately in my games.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the main engine initializes THEN it SHALL initialize both audio and resource systems successfully
2. WHEN the character system needs audio feedback THEN it SHALL be able to play sounds through the audio system
3. WHEN the graphics system needs textures THEN it SHALL load them through the resource manager
4. WHEN the primitive renderer draws objects THEN it SHALL be able to use loaded textures
5. WHEN the audio system needs audio clips THEN it SHALL load them through the resource manager
6. WHEN the camera moves THEN the audio listener SHALL update its position automatically
7. WHEN resources are no longer needed THEN they SHALL be automatically unloaded to free memory

### Requirement 4: Error Handling and Robustness

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want robust error handling so that my game doesn't crash when audio or resource loading fails.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN OpenAL initialization fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue without audio
2. WHEN an audio file is corrupted or missing THEN the system SHALL log an error and continue without that sound
3. WHEN a texture file is corrupted or missing THEN the system SHALL provide a default pink/magenta texture
4. WHEN a mesh file is corrupted or missing THEN the system SHALL provide a default cube mesh
5. WHEN running out of memory THEN the system SHALL attempt to free unused resources before failing
6. WHEN OpenAL device is lost THEN the system SHALL attempt to reinitialize the audio context
7. WHEN file system errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging

### Requirement 5: Performance and Memory Management

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want efficient resource and audio management so that my game runs smoothly without memory leaks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading resources THEN the system SHALL use efficient memory allocation patterns
2. WHEN audio is playing THEN it SHALL not cause frame rate drops or stuttering
3. WHEN resources are cached THEN the system SHALL use weak references to allow automatic cleanup
4. WHEN memory usage is high THEN the system SHALL automatically unload least recently used resources
5. WHEN audio sources are destroyed THEN their OpenAL resources SHALL be immediately freed
6. WHEN textures are unloaded THEN their GPU memory SHALL be immediately freed
7. WHEN the engine runs for extended periods THEN there SHALL be no memory leaks in audio or resource systems

### Requirement 6: Development and Debugging Support

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want debugging tools and logging so that I can troubleshoot audio and resource issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN audio operations occur THEN the system SHALL log important events (load, play, stop, error)
2. WHEN resources are loaded/unloaded THEN the system SHALL log the operations with file paths and memory usage
3. WHEN OpenAL errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed OpenAL error codes and descriptions
4. WHEN file loading fails THEN the system SHALL log the exact file path and error reason
5. WHEN running in debug mode THEN the system SHALL provide additional verbose logging
6. WHEN querying system status THEN the system SHALL provide current resource counts and memory usage
7. WHEN audio device changes THEN the system SHALL log device information and capabilities
