# Enhanced Game Experience - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the enhancement of Game Engine Kiro's example application to provide a more polished and comprehensive demonstration of the engine's capabilities. The goal is to transform the current basic example into a professional showcase that demonstrates all implemented features in a visually appealing and functional manner.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Clean Basic Example

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean basic example that focuses on core character movement without distractions, so that I can understand the fundamental mechanics clearly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the basic example is launched THEN the system SHALL display only a character with movement capabilities
2. WHEN audio systems are present in character code THEN the system SHALL remove all audio integration from the character class
3. WHEN complex meshes and textures are loaded THEN the system SHALL remove all mesh and texture loading from the basic example
4. WHEN unnecessary comments exist THEN the system SHALL remove outdated or meaningless comments
5. WHEN the character moves THEN the system SHALL support walking, jumping, and movement component switching
6. WHEN the hybrid movement component is used THEN the system SHALL set it as the default movement type
7. WHEN the example runs THEN the system SHALL display only essential UI information and controls

### Requirement 2: Enhanced Audio System Integration

**User Story:** As a player, I want immersive audio feedback during gameplay, so that the game feels responsive and engaging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game starts THEN the system SHALL play background music continuously
2. WHEN the character jumps THEN the system SHALL play a jump sound effect
3. WHEN the character walks THEN the system SHALL play footstep sounds synchronized with movement
4. WHEN audio is implemented in character THEN the system SHALL move audio logic to appropriate game layer
5. WHEN multiple audio sources exist THEN the system SHALL manage them efficiently without performance impact
6. WHEN audio files are missing THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and continue operation

### Requirement 3: Visual Character Enhancement

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see a realistic character model instead of a basic cube, so that the game feels more immersive and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the character is rendered THEN the system SHALL use the FBX T-Poser model instead of a cube
2. WHEN the FBX model is loaded THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing movement functionality
3. WHEN the character moves THEN the system SHALL properly animate or position the FBX model
4. WHEN movement components are switched THEN the system SHALL maintain visual consistency with the FBX model
5. WHEN the FBX model fails to load THEN the system SHALL fallback to the cube representation

### Requirement 4: Enhanced Environment Objects

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see various textured objects in the scene, so that I can evaluate the engine's rendering capabilities with different materials and textures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the scene is rendered THEN the system SHALL display exactly 3 cubes with different material properties
2. WHEN cube materials are applied THEN the system SHALL show one cube with texture, one with solid color, and one with no material
3. WHEN existing objects are present THEN the system SHALL maintain current object sizes and positions
4. WHEN textures are applied THEN the system SHALL use only texture materials (no complex material combinations)
5. WHEN objects are rendered THEN the system SHALL ensure proper lighting and shading on all objects

### Requirement 5: Professional Grid System

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a professional-looking grid system similar to commercial engines, so that I can better judge distances and positioning in the scene.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the grid is rendered THEN the system SHALL display a professional grid pattern with proper spacing
2. WHEN the sky color is set THEN the system SHALL use dark gray (almost black) instead of blue
3. WHEN grid lines are drawn THEN the system SHALL use subtle colors that don't interfere with scene objects
4. WHEN the grid extends THEN the system SHALL cover an appropriate area around the character spawn point
5. WHEN the camera moves THEN the system SHALL ensure grid visibility remains consistent and helpful

### Requirement 6: Comprehensive Feature Demonstration

**User Story:** As a developer evaluating the engine, I want to see all implemented features working visually, so that I can assess the engine's capabilities without running separate tests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the enhanced example runs THEN the system SHALL demonstrate all major engine systems visually
2. WHEN physics systems are active THEN the system SHALL show collision detection, rigid body simulation, and movement components
3. WHEN rendering systems are active THEN the system SHALL show primitive rendering, mesh rendering, texture mapping, and shader usage
4. WHEN audio systems are active THEN the system SHALL demonstrate 3D spatial audio, background music, and sound effects
5. WHEN resource systems are active THEN the system SHALL show model loading, texture loading, and resource management
6. WHEN input systems are active THEN the system SHALL respond to all defined controls and provide clear feedback
7. WHEN camera systems are active THEN the system SHALL demonstrate third-person camera with smooth movement and collision
8. WHEN the demonstration runs THEN the system SHALL maintain stable 60+ FPS performance with all features active
