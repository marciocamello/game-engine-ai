  - Analyze current Character class for audio dependencies
  - Remove all audio-related code from Character class implementation
  - Remove audio-related includes and member variables from Character header
  - Ensure Character class focuses only on movement and physics logic
  - Update Character class interface to remove audio parameters
  - Test that Character class works without audio dependencies
  - _Requirements: 2.4_

  - Test movement component switching with FBX model
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5_

- [ ] 5. Create enhanced environment objects

  - Design and implement exactly 3 cubes with different material properties
  - Create first cube with texture material applied
  - Create second cube with solid color material
  - Create third cube with no material (default rendering)
  - Maintain current object sizes and positions from existing implementation
  - Ensure proper lighting and shading on all environment objects
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5_

- [ ] 6. Implement professional grid system

  - Create GridRenderer component with professional grid pattern
  - Implement proper grid spacing and line thickness
  - Use subtle colors that don't interfere with scene objects
  - Set appropriate grid coverage area around character spawn
  - Ensure grid visibility remains consistent during camera movement
  - Replace blue sky color with dark gray (almost black) background
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5_

- [ ] 7. Create comprehensive feature demonstration

  - Integrate all enhanced components into main example
  - Ensure all major engine systems are visually demonstrated
  - Implement physics system demonstration (collision, rigid bodies, movement components)
  - Implement rendering system demonstration (primitives, meshes, textures, shaders)
  - Implement audio system demonstration (3D spatial audio, background music, sound effects)
  - Implement resource system demonstration (model loading, texture loading, resource management)
  - Implement input system demonstration with clear feedback
  - Implement camera system demonstration (third-person camera, smooth movement, collision)
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.7_

- [ ] 8. Optimize performance and ensure stability

  - Implement graceful fallbacks for all major systems
  - Test all controls and features for proper functionality
  - Ensure stable operation with all features enabled simultaneously
  - _Requirements: 6.8_

- [ ] 9. Update build system and documentation

  - Update CMakeLists.txt to include new basic example executable
  - Ensure both basic and enhanced examples build correctly
  - Update example documentation with new structure
  - Add comments explaining the difference between basic and enhanced examples
  - Test build system with both examples
  - _Requirements: All requirements integration_

- [ ] 10. Final integration testing and validation
  - Test basic example for clean, minimal functionality
  - Test enhanced example for comprehensive feature demonstration
  - Verify all audio systems work correctly (background music, footsteps, jump sounds)
  - Verify FBX character model loads and animates properly
  - Verify environment objects render with correct materials
  - Verify professional grid system displays correctly
  - Verify all existing controls and features continue to work
  - Perform final performance validation for 60+ FPS target
  - _Requirements: All requirements validation_
