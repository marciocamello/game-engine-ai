## Build and Development Notes

**Windows Development Workflow:**

- Use `.\scripts\build_unified.bat --tests` to build project
- Use `.\scripts\build_unified.bat  --clean-tests --tests` to build project and clean tests
- Use `.\scripts\build_unified.bat --tests TestName` to build single test
- Use `build\projects\GameExample\Release\GameExample.exe` to run enhanced GameExample
- Enhanced shader library will be integrated as optional module in existing architecture

**Testing Requirements:**

- All tests must follow testing-standards.md template structure exactly
- Focus on testing logic and algorithms rather than OpenGL-dependent functionality
- Never create fictitious tests just to pass - implement meaningful validation
- Run `.\scripts\run_tests.bat` before completing any task to ensure system stability
