# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements headless OpenGL testing capabilities for Game Engine Kiro on Windows, enabling automated testing of graphics components without requiring a physical display or GPU context. The solution provides both offscreen rendering contexts and configurable GPU usage flags to support different testing scenarios while maintaining the existing test architecture and build system integration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to run graphics tests in headless environments, so that I can validate rendering functionality in CI/CD pipelines without physical displays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running tests in a headless environment THEN the system SHALL create an offscreen OpenGL context using EGL or WGL_ARB_pbuffer
2. WHEN the offscreen context is created THEN it SHALL support OpenGL 4.6+ operations identical to windowed contexts
3. WHEN tests complete THEN the offscreen context SHALL be properly cleaned up without memory leaks
4. IF context creation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback options

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to disable GPU operations during unit tests, so that I can test data loading and processing logic without OpenGL dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN useGPU flag is set to false THEN graphics components SHALL skip all OpenGL calls
2. WHEN GPU operations are disabled THEN data structures SHALL still be populated with correct mesh and material data
3. WHEN running in CPU-only mode THEN tests SHALL execute significantly faster than GPU-enabled tests
4. IF GPU operations are disabled THEN the system SHALL still validate data integrity and parsing logic

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want seamless integration with existing test infrastructure, so that headless testing works with current build scripts and CMake configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building tests THEN CMakeLists.txt SHALL automatically detect and configure headless testing dependencies
2. WHEN running /scripts/build.bat THEN headless test executables SHALL be built alongside existing tests
3. WHEN executing tests THEN they SHALL follow the same naming convention as current integration tests
4. IF headless dependencies are missing THEN the build SHALL gracefully fallback with clear warnings

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want configurable test modes, so that I can choose between full GPU testing, CPU-only testing, or hybrid approaches based on the testing scenario.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring tests THEN the system SHALL support multiple test modes (GPU, CPU-only, hybrid)
2. WHEN in GPU mode THEN all graphics operations SHALL execute with offscreen context
3. WHEN in CPU-only mode THEN graphics operations SHALL be mocked or skipped
4. WHEN in hybrid mode THEN data loading SHALL be tested without GPU while validation includes GPU operations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Windows-native implementation, so that the headless testing solution is optimized for the engine's primary platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing offscreen contexts THEN the system SHALL prioritize Windows-native solutions (WGL_ARB_pbuffer or ANGLE EGL)
2. WHEN using external dependencies THEN they SHALL be managed through vcpkg following existing patterns
3. WHEN building on Windows THEN the solution SHALL integrate with MSVC toolchain and existing compiler flags
4. IF cross-platform support is needed THEN EGL SHALL be preferred over platform-specific solutions
