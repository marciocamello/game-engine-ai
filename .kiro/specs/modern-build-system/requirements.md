# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Game Engine Kiro requires a modern and reliable build system that addresses current issues of slow builds, frequent cache cleaning requirements, and inconsistencies in `build_unified.bat`. The goal is to implement modern build system best practices (Ninja, CMakePresets, vcpkg Binary Cache) while maintaining full compatibility with the current workflow, and fixing reliability issues in the unified build system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Reliable and Fast Build System

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a build system that works consistently without frequent cache cleaning, so that I can focus on development instead of build issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I execute `.\scripts\build_unified.bat --tests` THEN the system SHALL compile correctly without requiring prior cache cleaning
2. WHEN I execute incremental builds THEN the system SHALL recompile only modified files
3. WHEN I execute the same command twice consecutively THEN the system SHALL detect nothing changed and not recompile
4. WHEN I modify only one file THEN the system SHALL recompile only affected components
5. IF the build fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear and specific error messages
6. WHEN I use different build_unified.bat options THEN all SHALL work consistently

### Requirement 2: CMakePresets for Standardized Configurations

**User Story:** As a developer, I want standardized and reproducible build configurations, so that all developers have the same build environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I configure the project for the first time THEN the system SHALL automatically use optimized configurations via CMakePresets
2. WHEN different developers build THEN all SHALL obtain identical results
3. WHEN I use `cmake --preset dev` THEN the system SHALL automatically configure Ninja and optimizations
4. IF CMakePresets is not available THEN the system SHALL work with fallback to manual configuration
5. WHEN I execute `.\scripts\build_unified.bat` THEN the system SHALL automatically use presets when available

### Requirement 3: Ninja Generator for Efficient Incremental Builds

**User Story:** As a developer, I want fast and reliable incremental builds, so that I can iterate quickly during development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use Ninja as generator THEN incremental builds SHALL be 3-5x faster than current system
2. WHEN I modify a header THEN only files that actually depend on it SHALL be recompiled
3. WHEN I execute `ninja -d explain` THEN the system SHALL show exactly why each file was recompiled
4. IF Ninja is not available THEN the system SHALL use Visual Studio generator as fallback
5. WHEN I use `.\scripts\build_unified.bat` THEN the system SHALL detect and use Ninja automatically

### Requirement 4: vcpkg Binary Cache for Optimized Dependencies

**User Story:** As a developer, I want dependencies not to be recompiled unnecessarily, so that I save time on clean builds and CI/CD.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I do a clean build THEN already compiled dependencies SHALL be reused from binary cache
2. WHEN different developers build THEN all SHALL share the same dependency cache
3. WHEN I execute builds in CI/CD THEN the system SHALL use binary cache to accelerate the process
4. IF binary cache is not available THEN the system SHALL compile normally without failing
5. WHEN I update dependencies THEN only modified ones SHALL be recompiled

### Requirement 5: Fix build_unified.bat Issues

**User Story:** As a developer, I want `build_unified.bat` to work consistently like the old system worked, so that I have confidence in the build process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I execute `.\scripts\build_unified.bat --tests MathTest` THEN the system SHALL compile only the specified test consistently
2. WHEN I execute specific builds multiple times THEN all SHALL work without requiring cleaning
3. WHEN I use different flag combinations THEN all SHALL be processed correctly
4. IF a specific build fails THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent state for next attempts
5. WHEN I compare with the old system THEN reliability SHALL be equal or superior
6. WHEN I use `--engine`, `--projects`, `--tests` THEN each option SHALL work in isolation without interference
7. IF I execute the same command consecutively THEN the result SHALL be consistent

### Requirement 6: Full Compatibility with Current Workflow

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all improvements to be transparent to my current workflow, so that I don't need to learn new commands or processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use existing commands THEN all SHALL continue working exactly as before
2. WHEN I execute `.\scripts\build_unified.bat --tests` THEN behavior SHALL be identical, just faster
3. WHEN I use `.\scripts\run_tests.bat` THEN all tests SHALL execute normally
4. IF I want to use advanced features THEN they SHALL be available as additional options
5. WHEN new developers arrive THEN they SHALL use the same commands as always

### Requirement 7: Build Problem Detection and Diagnosis

**User Story:** As a developer, I want tools to diagnose when incremental builds don't work correctly, so that I can resolve issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an incremental build recompiles more than it should THEN the system SHALL provide explanation of the reason
2. WHEN I suspect cache problems THEN the system SHALL have command to verify cache state
3. WHEN builds fail inconsistently THEN the system SHALL have detailed logs for diagnosis
4. IF timestamps are incorrect THEN the system SHALL detect and report the problem
5. WHEN I need to force rebuild THEN the system SHALL have granular options (engine only, tests only, etc.)

### Requirement 8: Measurable Performance and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see clear performance improvement metrics, so that I can validate that optimizations are working.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I execute builds THEN the system SHALL report total compilation time
2. WHEN I compare with previous system THEN performance improvements SHALL be quantified
3. WHEN I do incremental builds THEN the system SHALL show how many files were recompiled
4. IF performance degrades THEN the system SHALL alert about possible problems
5. WHEN I use different configurations THEN the system SHALL show performance impact
