# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the critical need to reorganize the Game Engine Kiro project into a modular, plugin-based architecture. Currently, the project suffers from a monolithic structure where all components are tightly coupled, tests are mixed with game examples, and there's no clear separation between engine modules and game projects. This reorganization will establish a clean, scalable architecture that supports multiple game projects, modular engine components, and proper separation of concerns.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Modular Project Structure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clear separation between engine modules, game projects, and tests, so that I can work on specific components without affecting others and easily create new game projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing the project THEN the system SHALL create separate directories for engine modules, game projects, and tests
2. WHEN creating a new game project THEN the system SHALL provide a dedicated directory structure with its own CMakeLists.txt
3. WHEN building a specific game project THEN the system SHALL only compile the necessary engine modules and game-specific code
4. WHEN adding new engine modules THEN the system SHALL follow a standardized plugin/module interface
5. WHEN organizing tests THEN the system SHALL separate them from game projects into a dedicated testing structure

### Requirement 2: Plugin-Based Engine Architecture

**User Story:** As a developer, I want engine components (like physics engines, audio systems, renderers) to be modular plugins, so that I can easily swap implementations and add new features without modifying core engine code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing physics systems THEN Bullet Physics SHALL be a loadable module/plugin
2. WHEN implementing physics systems THEN PhysX SHALL be a loadable module/plugin
3. WHEN implementing audio systems THEN OpenAL SHALL be a modular component
4. WHEN implementing rendering systems THEN OpenGL renderer SHALL be a modular component
5. WHEN adding new modules THEN the system SHALL provide a standardized plugin interface
6. WHEN loading modules THEN the system SHALL support runtime module discovery and loading
7. WHEN configuring modules THEN the system SHALL provide a configuration system for enabling/disabling modules

### Requirement 3: Separated Test Architecture

**User Story:** As a developer, I want tests to be organized in a clear structure that separates engine tests from project tests, so that I can test engine components independently and potentially add project-specific tests in the future.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing engine tests THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing `tests/` directory structure for engine core, modules, and plugins
2. WHEN organizing project tests THEN the system SHALL create a dedicated `projects/Tests/` directory for future game project testing
3. WHEN building engine tests THEN the system SHALL continue using the existing test compilation system
4. WHEN building project tests THEN the system SHALL use a separate CMakeLists.txt for project test compilation
5. WHEN organizing test types THEN the system SHALL maintain separation between unit tests and integration tests in both structures

### Requirement 4: Game Project Template System

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to easily create new game projects with a standardized structure, so that I can focus on game development rather than project setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a new game project THEN the system SHALL provide a template structure
2. WHEN setting up a game project THEN the system SHALL include a dedicated CMakeLists.txt
3. WHEN organizing game code THEN the system SHALL provide standard directories for game-specific components
4. WHEN building a game project THEN the system SHALL only link necessary engine modules
5. WHEN configuring a game project THEN the system SHALL support game-specific configuration files

### Requirement 5: Module Dependency Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear dependency management between engine modules and game projects, so that I can understand and control which components are used in each project.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining module dependencies THEN the system SHALL provide a clear dependency declaration system
2. WHEN building projects THEN the system SHALL only compile required modules based on dependencies
3. WHEN adding new modules THEN the system SHALL validate dependency compatibility
4. WHEN configuring projects THEN the system SHALL support optional module loading
5. WHEN resolving dependencies THEN the system SHALL detect and report circular dependencies

### Requirement 6: Build System Reorganization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a hierarchical build system that supports building individual projects or the entire solution, so that I can optimize build times and work efficiently on specific components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing build files THEN the system SHALL create a root CMakeLists.txt that orchestrates sub-projects
2. WHEN building specific projects THEN the system SHALL support building individual game projects or test suites
3. WHEN managing dependencies THEN the system SHALL handle inter-project dependencies automatically
4. WHEN configuring builds THEN the system SHALL support different build configurations per project
5. WHEN executing builds THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with existing build scripts

### Requirement 7: Configuration and Asset Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want each game project to have its own configuration and asset management, so that different games can have different settings and resources without conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing assets THEN each game project SHALL have its own assets directory
2. WHEN managing configurations THEN each game project SHALL support project-specific configuration files
3. WHEN loading resources THEN the system SHALL support both shared engine assets and project-specific assets
4. WHEN deploying projects THEN the system SHALL copy only relevant assets to the build directory
5. WHEN sharing assets THEN the system SHALL support referencing shared engine assets from game projects
