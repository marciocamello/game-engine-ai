# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for resolving critical namespace and class name conflicts in the Game Engine Kiro project. The current codebase has multiple conflicting symbols, duplicated class names, and inconsistent namespace usage that is causing compilation errors and symbol resolution issues. Additionally, the legacy `examples/` directory needs to be cleaned up as it conflicts with the new `projects/` structure.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Resolve Animation Class Name Conflicts

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to have distinct and unambiguous class names for different animation systems, so that I can use both graphics animation and gameplay animation without compilation errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is compiled THEN there SHALL be no duplicate class names between `GameEngine::Animation::Animation` and `GameEngine::Animation` (Graphics)
2. WHEN including animation headers THEN the compiler SHALL resolve class names without ambiguity
3. WHEN using animation classes THEN developers SHALL be able to distinguish between skeletal animation and graphics animation systems
4. WHEN linking the project THEN there SHALL be no symbol conflicts between animation classes

### Requirement 2: Standardize Namespace Structure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a consistent and logical namespace hierarchy, so that I can easily understand and navigate the codebase structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the codebase THEN all animation-related classes SHALL use the `GameEngine::Animation` namespace consistently
2. WHEN examining the codebase THEN all graphics-related classes SHALL use the `GameEngine::Graphics` namespace consistently
3. WHEN examining the codebase THEN there SHALL be no namespace conflicts between different subsystems
4. WHEN using namespaces THEN the hierarchy SHALL follow the pattern `GameEngine::[Subsystem]::[Component]`

### Requirement 3: Eliminate Duplicate Header Files

**User Story:** As a developer, I want each class to have a single, authoritative header file, so that I don't have confusion about which header to include.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN searching for animation headers THEN there SHALL be only one `Animation.h` file per distinct class
2. WHEN searching for skeleton headers THEN there SHALL be only one `Skeleton.h` file per distinct class
3. WHEN including headers THEN each class SHALL have a unique and unambiguous include path
4. WHEN building the project THEN there SHALL be no duplicate symbol definitions

### Requirement 4: Update All Include References

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all include statements to reference the correct and updated header paths, so that the project compiles without missing dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining source files THEN all `#include` statements SHALL reference the correct header paths
2. WHEN examining test files THEN all `#include` statements SHALL reference the updated header paths
3. WHEN examining project files THEN all `#include` statements SHALL reference the updated header paths
4. WHEN building any component THEN all dependencies SHALL be resolved correctly

### Requirement 5: Update Namespace Usage Throughout Codebase

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all namespace usage to be consistent with the new structure, so that there are no compilation errors due to incorrect namespace references.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining source files THEN all `using namespace` statements SHALL reference the correct namespaces
2. WHEN examining source files THEN all fully-qualified class names SHALL use the correct namespace paths
3. WHEN examining test files THEN all namespace usage SHALL be updated to match the new structure
4. WHEN examining project files THEN all namespace usage SHALL be updated to match the new structure

### Requirement 6: Clean Up Legacy Examples Directory

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the legacy examples directory to be properly cleaned up, so that there are no build conflicts with the new projects structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the CMakeLists.txt THEN there SHALL be no references to the `examples/` directory for executable builds
2. WHEN examining the build system THEN all example executables SHALL be moved to or referenced from the `projects/` structure
3. WHEN building the project THEN there SHALL be no conflicts between `examples/` and `projects/` directories
4. WHEN the cleanup is complete THEN the `examples/` directory SHALL either be removed or clearly marked as deprecated

### Requirement 7: Maintain Backward Compatibility Where Possible

**User Story:** As a developer, I want existing functionality to continue working after the refactoring, so that I don't have to rewrite large portions of working code unnecessarily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN all existing tests SHALL continue to pass
2. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN all existing functionality SHALL remain intact
3. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN the public API SHALL maintain compatibility where feasible
4. WHEN breaking changes are necessary THEN they SHALL be clearly documented and justified

### Requirement 8: Ensure Build System Consistency

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the build system to work correctly with the new structure, so that I can build and test the project without issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running the build THEN all components SHALL compile successfully
2. WHEN running tests THEN all tests SHALL execute without symbol resolution errors
3. WHEN building projects THEN all example projects SHALL build with the updated structure
4. WHEN using the build scripts THEN they SHALL work correctly with the refactored codebase

### Requirement 9: Update Documentation and Comments

**User Story:** As a developer, I want documentation and comments to reflect the new structure, so that I can understand and maintain the codebase effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining header files THEN all documentation SHALL reference the correct class and namespace names
2. WHEN examining source files THEN all comments SHALL use the updated naming conventions
3. WHEN examining README files THEN they SHALL reflect the new project structure
4. WHEN examining API documentation THEN it SHALL be updated to match the refactored code

### Requirement 10: Validate Refactoring Completeness

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure that the refactoring is complete and correct, so that no conflicts or issues remain in the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN searching the codebase THEN there SHALL be no remaining namespace conflicts
2. WHEN searching the codebase THEN there SHALL be no remaining class name conflicts
3. WHEN building the entire project THEN there SHALL be no compilation or linking errors
4. WHEN running all tests THEN they SHALL pass without errors related to the refactoring
