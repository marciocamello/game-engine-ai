# Requirements Document - NVIDIA PhysX Integration

## Introduction

This specification covers the integration of NVIDIA PhysX as a high-performance alternative physics backend for Game Engine Kiro v1.1. The goal is to provide developers with the choice between Bullet Physics (compatibility-focused) and NVIDIA PhysX (performance-focused) while maintaining a unified API interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Dual-Backend Physics Architecture

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want to choose between different physics backends so that I can optimize for either compatibility or performance based on my project needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initializing the physics engine THEN the system SHALL support automatic backend selection based on hardware capabilities
2. WHEN PhysX is available THEN the system SHALL prefer PhysX for better performance
3. WHEN PhysX is not available THEN the system SHALL fallback to Bullet Physics automatically
4. WHEN switching backends THEN the system SHALL maintain the same API interface for all physics operations
5. WHEN querying the current backend THEN the system SHALL return the active backend type
6. WHEN both backends are available THEN the system SHALL allow manual backend selection via configuration
7. WHEN backend initialization fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and attempt fallback

### Requirement 2: PhysX SDK Integration

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want PhysX properly integrated so that I can leverage GPU acceleration and advanced physics features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN PhysX initializes THEN it SHALL create a proper PhysX foundation, physics system, and scene

4. WHEN performing collision detection THEN PhysX SHALL provide accurate raycast and sweep test results
5. WHEN applying forces THEN PhysX SHALL handle force and impulse application correctly
6. WHEN the physics world updates THEN PhysX SHALL simulate physics at the specified timestep

3. WHEN compared to Bullet Physics THEN PhysX SHALL demonstrate at least 2x performance improvement in rigid body simulation
4. WHEN memory usage is measured THEN PhysX SHALL use memory efficiently without excessive allocation
5. WHEN profiling physics updates THEN PhysX SHALL complete updates in less than 16ms for typical game scenarios
6. WHEN handling collision detection THEN PhysX SHALL provide faster collision queries than Bullet Physics
7. WHEN scaling particle count THEN PhysX SHALL handle large particle systems more efficiently

### Requirement 4: Unified API Compatibility

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want to switch between physics backends without changing my game code so that I can easily compare performance and compatibility.

7. WHEN serializing physics state THEN both backends SHALL support compatible save/load functionality

### Requirement 5: Advanced PhysX Features

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want access to advanced PhysX features so that I can create more sophisticated physics simulations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN continuous collision detection is enabled THEN PhysX SHALL prevent fast-moving objects from tunneling
2. WHEN using advanced collision shapes THEN PhysX SHALL support convex meshes and triangle meshes
3. WHEN configuring simulation parameters THEN PhysX SHALL allow fine-tuning of solver iterations and timesteps
4. WHEN using multi-threading THEN PhysX SHALL distribute physics work across multiple CPU cores
5. WHEN GPU memory is available THEN PhysX SHALL utilize GPU memory for physics data
6. WHEN debugging physics THEN PhysX SHALL provide debug visualization capabilities
7. WHEN profiling performance THEN PhysX SHALL provide detailed performance statistics

### Requirement 6: Hardware Detection and Optimization

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want the engine to automatically optimize physics settings based on available hardware so that users get the best performance on their systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN detecting hardware THEN the system SHALL identify NVIDIA GPUs with CUDA support
2. WHEN CUDA is available THEN the system SHALL enable GPU acceleration automatically
3. WHEN GPU memory is limited THEN the system SHALL adjust physics settings to fit available memory
4. WHEN CPU cores are available THEN the system SHALL configure multi-threading appropriately
5. WHEN hardware capabilities change THEN the system SHALL adapt physics settings dynamically
6. WHEN benchmarking performance THEN the system SHALL measure and compare backend performance
7. WHEN optimal settings are determined THEN the system SHALL save and reuse configuration

### Requirement 7: Error Handling and Robustness

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want robust error handling so that physics backend issues don't crash my game.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN PhysX initialization fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information and fallback to Bullet
2. WHEN GPU acceleration fails THEN PhysX SHALL fallback to CPU simulation gracefully
3. WHEN CUDA drivers are outdated THEN the system SHALL detect this and provide helpful error messages
4. WHEN physics simulation encounters errors THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully without crashing
5. WHEN memory allocation fails THEN the system SHALL reduce physics complexity and continue running
6. WHEN device context is lost THEN the system SHALL attempt to recover or fallback appropriately
7. WHEN debugging is enabled THEN the system SHALL provide verbose logging for troubleshooting

### Requirement 8: Integration with Existing Systems

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want PhysX to work seamlessly with existing engine components so that I can use it immediately in my games.

#### Acceptance Criteria
