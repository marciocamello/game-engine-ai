# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on finalizing the physics system implementation through comprehensive testing, performance optimization, memory management improvements, and bug resolution. Building upon the completed bullet-physics-integration, this phase ensures production-ready quality with 100% test coverage using the established TestOutput framework, detailed performance profiling, optimized memory usage, and resolution of identified issues.
