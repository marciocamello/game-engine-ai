# Requirements Document - Simple Testing System

## Introduction

This specification defines a lightweight, framework-independent testing system for Game Engine Kiro. The system prioritizes simplicity, cross-platform compatibility, and professional output formatting without external dependencies like GoogleTest or other testing frameworks.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Framework-Independent Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to write and run tests without external testing framework dependencies, so that the build system remains simple and fast.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing a test THEN the system SHALL use only standard C++ libraries and engine headers
2. WHEN building tests THEN the system SHALL NOT require GoogleTest, Catch2, or any external testing framework
3. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL execute as standalone executables
4. WHEN integrating with CMake THEN the system SHALL compile tests as part of the main build process

### Requirement 2: Professional Output Formatting

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent and professional test output, so that results are clear and compatible across all platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying test results THEN the system SHALL use text-based status indicators (e.g., [PASS], [FAILED])
2. WHEN outputting messages THEN the system SHALL NOT use Unicode icons, emoticons, or special characters
3. WHEN showing test progress THEN the system SHALL use consistent formatting with clear headers and separators
4. WHEN reporting errors THEN the system SHALL use standardized prefixes ([ERROR], [WARNING], [INFO])
5. WHEN tests complete THEN the system SHALL display a clear summary with overall status

### Requirement 3: Simple Test Structure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to write tests using a simple, predictable pattern, so that creating new tests is straightforward and consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a test function THEN it SHALL return a boolean indicating success/failure
2. WHEN validating conditions THEN the system SHALL use standard C++ assert() for immediate failure
3. WHEN organizing tests THEN each test file SHALL contain multiple test functions and a main() function
4. WHEN structuring test files THEN they SHALL follow the pattern: setup, execution, validation, cleanup
5. WHEN naming test functions THEN they SHALL use the pattern TestComponentFeature()

### Requirement 4: Cross-Platform Compatibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want tests to run consistently on all supported platforms, so that the testing system works reliably in all environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running on Windows THEN the system SHALL display output correctly in cmd and PowerShell
2. WHEN running on different terminals THEN the system SHALL avoid encoding issues
3. WHEN integrating with CI/CD THEN the system SHALL produce parseable output
4. WHEN using in automated systems THEN the system SHALL return proper exit codes (0 for success, 1 for failure)

### Requirement 5: Integration with Build System

**User Story:** As a developer, I want tests to be automatically built and easily executed, so that testing is seamlessly integrated into the development workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building the project THEN test executables SHALL be created automatically
2. WHEN adding new tests THEN they SHALL be integrated via CMakeLists.txt configuration
3. WHEN linking tests THEN they SHALL have access to the main engine library
4. WHEN organizing test files THEN they SHALL be placed in appropriate directories (tests/unit/, tests/integration/)

### Requirement 6: Comprehensive Test Coverage Support

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test different types of engine components, so that I can validate both unit-level and integration-level functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing math operations THEN the system SHALL support floating-point comparison with epsilon tolerance
2. WHEN testing engine components THEN the system SHALL provide access to all engine headers and functionality
3. WHEN creating integration tests THEN the system SHALL support testing component interactions
4. WHEN validating complex operations THEN the system SHALL support custom validation functions

### Requirement 7: Error Handling and Debugging

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear error reporting and debugging support, so that I can quickly identify and fix test failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a test fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with context
2. WHEN an exception occurs THEN the system SHALL catch and report it with proper formatting
3. WHEN debugging tests THEN the system SHALL be compatible with Visual Studio debugger
4. WHEN tests crash THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error information

### Requirement 8: Documentation and Standards

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear documentation and coding standards, so that I can write consistent tests and understand the testing approach.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing tests THEN developers SHALL have access to comprehensive coding standards documentation
2. WHEN creating new tests THEN developers SHALL have working examples to follow
3. WHEN establishing output formatting THEN the system SHALL enforce consistent logging standards across all components
4. WHEN maintaining the codebase THEN the system SHALL provide guidelines for professional output formatting
