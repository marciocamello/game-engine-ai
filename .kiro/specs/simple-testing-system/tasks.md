# Implementation Plan - Simple Testing System

Convert the simple testing system design into a series of implementation tasks that build incrementally on the existing working foundation.

## Tasks

- [x] 1. Establish testing foundation and standards

  - Create comprehensive coding standards documentation for consistent output formatting
  - Implement helper utility functions for common test operations (floating-point comparison, timing)
  - Establish CMake patterns for easy test integration
  - Create template files for new test creation
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 2.2, 8.1, 8.3_

- [x] 2. Expand math testing coverage

  - [x] 2.1 Create comprehensive matrix testing

    - Implement test_matrix.cpp with Matrix4 operations testing
    - Add matrix multiplication, inversion, and transformation tests
    - Include edge case testing for singular matrices and boundary conditions
    - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 3.1, 3.4_

  - [x] 2.2 Create quaternion testing suite

    - Implement test_quaternion.cpp with rotation and orientation testing
    - Add quaternion multiplication, normalization, and conversion tests
    - Include SLERP and rotation composition testing
    - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 3.1, 3.4_

  - [x] 2.3 Enhance existing math tests

    - Expand test_math.cpp with additional vector operations
    - Add cross product, dot product, and normalization edge cases
    - Include performance testing for critical math operations
    - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.4_

- [x] 3. Enhance existing physics testing coverage

  - [x] 3.1 Expand physics integration tests

    - Enhance existing test_bullet_integration.cpp with additional scenarios
    - Add more comprehensive physics world testing
    - Include edge cases for physics object creation and destruction
    - _Requirements: 6.2, 7.1, 7.2, 2.4_

  - [x] 3.2 Improve physics utilities testing

    - Enhance existing test_bullet_utils_simple.cpp with more conversion scenarios
    - Add boundary condition testing for coordinate conversions
    - Include precision testing for floating-point conversions
    - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.4_

- [x] 4. Implement custom assertion macros

  - Create EXPECT_NEAR_VEC3, EXPECT_MATRIX_EQUAL, and similar macros for math/physics testing
  - Add detailed failure reporting with context information
  - Include file and line number reporting for failed assertions
  - _Requirements: 7.1, 7.2, 3.2, 3.4_

- [x] 5. Create comprehensive testing guide

  - Write detailed documentation for test creation and execution
  - Include best practices and common patterns based on existing tests
  - Add troubleshooting guide for common testing issues
  - Document how to add new tests to the existing framework
  - _Requirements: 8.1, 8.2, 8.4_
