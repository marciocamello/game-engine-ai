# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on improving the testing documentation for Game Engine Kiro, specifically addressing the limitations and best practices when testing graphics resources without OpenGL context. The goal is to provide comprehensive guidance for developers on how to write effective tests for resource management systems, handle OpenGL dependencies, and implement proper mock resources.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer working on the engine, I want comprehensive documentation about testing limitations without OpenGL context, so that I can understand when and how to write tests that don't require graphics initialization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer reads the testing documentation THEN the system SHALL provide clear explanations of OpenGL context limitations in testing environments
2. WHEN a developer encounters OpenGL-dependent code THEN the documentation SHALL explain alternative testing approaches
3. WHEN a developer needs to test graphics resources THEN the documentation SHALL provide guidance on context-aware testing strategies
4. IF a test requires OpenGL context THEN the documentation SHALL explain how to detect and handle missing context gracefully

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer writing tests for resource management, I want a comprehensive guide on best practices for testing resources, so that I can write effective and maintainable tests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer writes resource tests THEN the documentation SHALL provide patterns for testing resource lifecycle management
2. WHEN a developer needs to test caching behavior THEN the documentation SHALL include examples of cache validation testing
3. WHEN a developer tests memory management THEN the documentation SHALL provide guidelines for memory usage verification
4. WHEN a developer writes integration tests THEN the documentation SHALL explain how to test resource interactions safely

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer creating mock resources for testing, I want documented patterns and examples, so that I can implement consistent and effective mock objects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer needs to create mock resources THEN the documentation SHALL provide standardized mock resource patterns
2. WHEN a developer implements mock behavior THEN the documentation SHALL include examples of proper mock resource implementation
3. WHEN a developer tests without OpenGL THEN the documentation SHALL show how to use mock resources effectively
4. IF a mock resource needs to simulate GPU behavior THEN the documentation SHALL provide patterns for realistic simulation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer using the engine API, I want updated API reference documentation that includes the new resource management functionality, so that I can understand and use the enhanced features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer accesses API documentation THEN the system SHALL include documentation for GetMemoryUsage and GetResourceCount methods
2. WHEN a developer looks up ResourceManager THEN the documentation SHALL include the new caching and statistics functionality
3. WHEN a developer needs OpenGL context utilities THEN the documentation SHALL include OpenGLContext class reference
4. WHEN a developer uses resource debugging features THEN the documentation SHALL provide complete usage examples

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the testing system, I want standardized test output formatting guidelines, so that all tests produce consistent and readable output.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer writes new tests THEN the documentation SHALL provide standardized output formatting requirements
2. WHEN a test produces output THEN the system SHALL follow consistent formatting patterns across all test types
3. WHEN a test reports results THEN the documentation SHALL specify required output elements and structure
4. IF a test needs custom output THEN the documentation SHALL provide guidelines for maintaining consistency
