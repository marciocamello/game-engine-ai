- **[Player Implementation](player-implementation.md)** - Creating a player controller with physics
- **[Main Entry Point](main-entry-point.md)** - Setting up the application entry point

### Architecture Guides

- **[Modular Architecture Guide](../modular-architecture.md)** - Understanding the engine's modular design
- **[Migration Guide](../migration-guide.md)** - Migrating from the old monolithic structure
- **[Module Development Guide](../module-development-guide.md)** - Creating custom engine modules
- **[Module Best Practices](../module-development-best-practices.md)** - Best practices for module development

## Tutorial Prerequisites

Before starting these tutorials, ensure you have:

1. **Game Engine Kiro** installed and built successfully
2. **Visual Studio 2019+** or compatible C++20 compiler
3. **CMake 3.16+** for build configuration
4. **Basic C++ knowledge** including modern C++ features
5. **Understanding of game development concepts** (optional but helpful)

## Quick Start Guide

### 1. Verify Installation

```powershell
# Build the engine to verify everything works
.\scripts\build_unified.bat --tests

# Run tests to ensure stability
.\scripts\run_tests.bat
```

### 2. Choose Your Starting Point

- **New to Game Engine Kiro?** Start with [Creating a New Project](creating-new-project.md)
- **Migrating existing code?** Begin with [Migration Guide](../migration-guide.md)
- **Want to create engine modules?** Check [Module Development Guide](../module-development-guide.md)

### 3. Follow the Tutorials

Each tutorial builds upon the previous one:

1. **Project Setup** - Directory structure and configuration
2. **Game Implementation** - Core game logic and engine integration
3. **Player Controller** - Character movement and physics
4. **Main Application** - Entry point and game loop

## Tutorial Features

### Complete Code Examples

All tutorials include:

- âœ… Complete, working code examples
- âœ… Detailed explanations of each step
- âœ… Error handling and best practices
- âœ… Performance considerations
- âœ… Asset management examples

### Modular Architecture Focus

Tutorials emphasize:

- ðŸ”§ Module-based design patterns
- ðŸ”§ Clean separation of concerns
- ðŸ”§ Configuration-driven development
- ðŸ”§ Extensible and maintainable code

### Real-World Examples

Examples demonstrate:

- ðŸŽ® Third-person character controller
- ðŸŽ® Physics integration with Bullet
- ðŸŽ® Graphics rendering with OpenGL
- ðŸŽ® Audio system integration
- ðŸŽ® Input handling and camera control

## Common Use Cases

### Creating a Third-Person Game

Follow the complete tutorial series:

1. [Creating a New Project](creating-new-project.md)
2. [Project Implementation](project-implementation.md)
3. [Player Implementation](player-implementation.md)
4. [Main Entry Point](main-entry-point.md)

### Extending Engine Functionality

For custom modules and extensions:

1. [Module Development Guide](../module-development-guide.md)
2. [Module Best Practices](../module-development-best-practices.md)

### Migrating Existing Projects

For existing Game Engine Kiro projects:

1. [Migration Guide](../migration-guide.md)
2. [Modular Architecture Guide](../modular-architecture.md)

## Tutorial Support

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check the logs**: `logs/` directory contains detailed error information
2. **Use debug builds**: `.\scripts\debug.bat` for additional debugging info
3. **Monitor real-time**: `.\scripts\monitor.bat` for live log monitoring
4. **Review examples**: `projects/GameExample/` and `projects/BasicExample/`

### Common Issues

#### Build Problems

```powershell
# Clean and rebuild
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force build -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
.\scripts\build_unified.bat --tests
```

#### Asset Loading Issues

- Verify asset paths in configuration files
- Check that assets are copied to build directory
- Review asset loading logs for specific errors

#### Module Registration Errors

- Ensure modules are registered before engine initialization
- Check module dependencies are satisfied
- Verify module configuration is correct

### Best Practices Reminders

1. **Always use the unified build script**: `.\scripts\build_unified.bat --tests`
2. **Test frequently**: Run `.\scripts\run_tests.bat` after changes
3. **Follow the directory structure**: Keep projects in `projects/` directory
4. **Use configuration files**: Avoid hardcoded settings
5. **Handle errors gracefully**: Include comprehensive error handling

## Advanced Topics

### Performance Optimization

- Use Release builds for performance testing
- Profile your game regularly
- Optimize asset loading and rendering
- Consider object pooling for frequently created objects

### Multi-threading Considerations

- Design modules to be thread-safe when necessary
- Use atomic operations for shared state
- Consider future parallelization in your design

### Memory Management

- Use RAII and smart pointers
- Avoid memory leaks with proper cleanup
- Consider memory pools for performance-critical code
