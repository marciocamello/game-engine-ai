## 2. Core Engine Architecture

A modular and extensible architecture is crucial for long-term development.

### 2.1. Engine Modules (High-Level)

- **Core:** Basic utilities, memory management, logging, math library, data structures.
- **Graphics Renderer:** Abstraction layer for OpenGL/Vulkan, scene graph management, rendering pipeline.
- **Resource Manager:** Loading, unloading, and managing game assets (models, textures, shaders, sounds).
- **Physics Engine:** Integration with industry-leading physics libraries:
  - **NVIDIA PhysX** (Recommended) - Advanced physics simulation with GPU acceleration
  - **Bullet Physics** - Open-source alternative with broad compatibility
  - **Dual Support** - Runtime selection between physics backends

### 2.2. Physics Engine Comparison & Architecture

#### **NVIDIA PhysX vs Bullet Physics**

| Feature               | NVIDIA PhysX               | Bullet Physics                 |
| --------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Performance**       | Superior GPU acceleration  | CPU-based, good optimization   |
| **Licensing**         | Free for commercial use    | Open-source (Zlib license)     |
| **Platform Support**  | Windows, Linux, consoles   | Cross-platform (all platforms) |
| **Advanced Features** | Cloth, fluids, destruction | Basic rigid/soft body          |
| **Industry Adoption** | AAA games (Unreal, Unity)  | Indie games, open projects     |
| **GPU Acceleration**  | ‚úÖ CUDA support            | ‚ùå CPU only                    |
| **Memory Usage**      | Optimized for large scenes | Lightweight                    |
| **Learning Curve**    | Moderate                   | Easier to start                |

#### **Recommended Physics Backend Selection**

```cpp
// Runtime physics backend selection
enum class PhysicsBackend {
    PhysX,      // For high-performance, GPU-accelerated physics
    Bullet,     // For compatibility and lightweight scenarios
    Auto        // Automatic selection based on hardware
};

// Configuration example
PhysicsConfig config;
config.backend = PhysicsBackend::Auto;  // Let engine decide
config.enableGPU = true;                // Prefer GPU acceleration
config.fallbackToBullet = true;         // Fallback if PhysX unavailable
```

#### **Implementation Strategy**

1. **Phase 1** (Current): Bullet Physics foundation
2. **Phase 2**: PhysX integration with abstraction layer
3. **Phase 3**: Runtime backend switching
4. **Phase 4**: Hybrid mode (PhysX + Bullet for different systems)
