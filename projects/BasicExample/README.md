# BasicExample

This is a clean, focused example that demonstrates core movement mechanics without distractions:

- WASD character movement
- Jumping mechanics
- Movement component switching
- Third-person camera controls
- Basic physics integration

This example is ideal for learning the fundamentals of the engine without the complexity of advanced features.

## Building

From the BasicExample directory:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --config Release
```

## Running

After building, the executable will be in the build directory. The program will automatically copy required assets from the main engine.

## Assets

This project uses shared assets from the main engine assets directory.
